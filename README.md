## Preparations for this training

In order to prepare to this training you should/must do the following List of readings and exercises. If you have questions, please open an issue and we will be glad to answer, you might be helping other participants too.

### TODO List

* Complete some of the [makemehapi](https://github.com/spumko/makemehapi) workshopper.
* Come up with an API that you would like to build, nothing too fancy, just a few endpoints that you would like to expose. It could be anything you like, here are some data source ideas:
    * An API that exists but you'd like to make it better
    * A combination of a few different publicly accessible APIs
    * A site that has data in HTML but not no data API to serve the data

Some places to find inspiration for data and APIs:
* [Portugal's Open Data](http://www.dados.gov.pt/pt/inicio/inicio.aspx)
* [EU Open Data](https://open-data.europa.eu/en/data/)
* [Fire data from Portugal](http://www.incendios.pt/pt)
* [Programmable Web](http://www.programmableweb.com/)

### Materials
